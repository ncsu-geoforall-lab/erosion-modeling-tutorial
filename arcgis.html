Topic: Erosion modeling

Task: Compute soil detachment and net erosion/deposition using simple GIS-based models

</pre>

<p>
create the assignment working directory (folder) .\Assign12<br>

start ArcMap<br>

<pre>
Start->Programs->ArcGIS->ArcMap

</pre>

<p>
Check out a Spatial Analyst Extension license<br>

<pre>
Under Tools->Extensions make sure there is a check next to 'Spatial Analyst'
Select View->Toolbars->Spatial Analyst to activate the extension

</pre>

<p>
Compute a map of soil detachment rate using RUSLE3d equation which assumes that there is no deposition<br>
(this represents detachment limited sediment transport by overland flow)<br>
E = RKLSCP, where LS = 1.4 * (U/22.1)**0.4 * (sin (slope/0.09))**1.2<br>
E is the annual soil detachment rate (soil loss)<br>
R is the rainfall, K is the soil, C is the land cover and P is the preventive measures factor<br>
LS is the topography factor, U is contributing area per unit width (function of flowaccumulation)<br>
for units and explanation of constants see <a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea582/common/GIS_anal_assign/erosion_notes2.pdf"><b>Erosion modeling notes</b></a><br>


First compute slope, and flowaccumulation for the elevation raster map e_lid792 (NOT elid_792)<br>


<pre>
In ArcMap
Add the raster feature layer: ncrast.mdb/e_lid792  (NOT elid_792)
Open the ArcToolbox

</pre>

<p>
Compute slope_1m map using the Slope function<br>


<pre>
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Slope'
Set 'Input' to 'e_lid792'
Set 'Output Raster Dataset' to '.\Assign12\slope_1m'
keep DEGREES for units
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
Compute the flow accumulation map Flowacc<br>


<pre>
Set your Workspace and Scratch Workspace to .\Assign12.
Hint: Geoprocessing->Environments->Workspace

</pre>

<p>
Using the Spatial Analyst Extension, perform the following:<br>


<pre>
Compute Fill input=e_lid792 output=Fill_e_lid
Compute FlowDirection input=Fill_e_lid ouput=FlowDir_fil
Compute FlowAccumulation input=FlowDir_fil output=Flowacc

</pre>

<p>

Compute a map of soil detachment rate using RUSLE3d equation<br>
Build an expression in the Spatial Analyst Raster Calculator for lsfac map<br>
using the Flowacc and slope_1m layers you just generated.<br>
Note that the lsfac map represents the topographic factor LS used in the RUSLE3d model<br>
Flowacc map multiplied by resolution is the contributing area per unit width U<br>
the surface slope is the earlier computed slope_1m layer<br>


<pre>
In the ArcToolbox, Select 'Spatial Analyst->Map Algebra->Raster Calculator

</pre>

<p>
Type in the expression for lsfac layer (make sure you have spaces around operators)<br>
slope should be in radians,<br>
flowaccumulation is in number of cells so we multiply by resolution<br>


<pre>
1.4 * (Power("Flowacc" * 1. / 22.1 , 0.4) * Power((Sin(("slope_1m" / 0.09 )* math.pi/180.0) ) , 1.2))
Set the output raster to lsfac
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
Build the expression for soil detachment rate E (soil loss) s_loss<br>
cfactb is the land cover factor (C), soils_kf is the soil erodibility (K)<br>
From ncrast.mdb add: cfactb (C) and soil factor soils_kf (K) to your project.<br>
Hint: hold down control key to select multiple  layers<br>
the rainfall factor (R) is set here to be 270.0<br>
the prevention measures factor (P) is here taken to = 1.0<br>
if the expression does not work try moving the constant to the end of expression<br>


<pre>
270.0 * "cfactb" * "lsfac" * "soils_kf"
Click 'OK'

Adjust color table for the s_loss map - histogram equalized color ramp may be needed
Find average soil loss rate in the area from the s_loss map (in Properties:Source)

</pre>

<p>

USPED model<br>
Compute net erosion and deposition as a divergence of sediment flow vector field<br>
note that custom color tables that cover entire range of values<br>
including negative are important in this section<br>

We have already computed slope_1m and flowaccumulation, but we will also need direction of flow<br>
Compute aspect_1m map (direction of flow, direction of gradient vector) using the Aspect function<br>

<pre>
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Aspect'
Set 'Input' to 'e_lid792'
Set 'Output Raster Dataset' to '.\Assign12\aspect_1m'
keep DEGREES for units
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
Build an expression for sflowtopo (topographic factor LS for sediment flow T)<br>
using the Raster Calculator<br>
For the exponents use m=n=1, resolution is 1.<br>


<pre>
"Flowacc" * 1. * Sin("slope_1m" * math.pi/180.0)
output raster = sflowtopo

</pre>

<p>
OR use m=1.3 and n=1.2 for study areas with extensive rills,<br>
in this case, channels/streams will have large erosion rates due to high values of flowaccumulation<br>


<pre>
(Power("Flowacc" * 1. , 1.3) * Power((Sin("slope_1m" * math.pi/180.0)), 1.2))
output raster = sflowtopo
CLick "OK"

</pre>

<p>
Compute divergence of sediment flow,<br>

first compute components of sediment flow in x and y direction<br>


<pre>
Build an expression for: qsx
"sflowtopo" * "soils_kf" * "cfactb" * 270. * Cos((- "aspect_1m" + 450.) * math.pi / 180.0) 
Output raster = qsx
Click "OK"

Build an expression for: qsy
"sflowtopo" * "soils_kf" * "cfactb" * 270. * Sin((- "aspect_1m" + 450.) * math.pi / 180.0) 
Output raster = qsy
Click "OK"

</pre>

<p>
compute components of change in sediment flow in x and y direction<br>
as partial derivatives of sediment flow field, derived from slope and aspect - see eqs 1,2,3 from here:<br>
http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hmitaso/gmslab/reports/cerl99/rep99.html<br>

<pre>
In ArcToolbox
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Slope'
Set 'Input' to 'qsx'
Set 'Output Raster Dataset' to '.\Assign12\Slope_qsx'
Keep DEGREES for units
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
do the same for Aspect to compute Aspect_qsx<br>

<pre>
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Aspect'
Set 'Input' to 'qsx'
Set 'Output Raster Dataset' to '.\Assign12\Aspect_qsx'
Click 'OK'

In ArcToolbox
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Slope'
Set 'Input' to 'qsy'
Set 'Output Raster Dataset' to '.\Assign12\Slope_qsy'
Keep DEGREES for units
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
do the same for Aspect to compute Aspect_qsy<br>

<pre>
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Aspect'
Set 'Input' to 'qsy'
Set 'Output Raster Dataset' to '.\Assign12\Aspect_qsy'
Click 'OK'

Using the 'Spatial Analyst->Map Algebra->Raster Calculator:
Build an expression for: qsx_dx
Cos((- "Aspect_qsx" + 450) * math.pi / 180.0) * Tan("Slope_qsx" * math.pi/180.0)
Click'OK'

Build an expression for: qsy_dy
Sin((- "Aspect_qsy" + 450) * math.pi / 180.0) * Tan("Slope_qsy" * math.pi/180.0)
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
Compute net erosion deposition<br>

<pre>
Build an expression for: erdep
"qsx_dx" + "qsy_dy"
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
Assign an appropriate color classification scheme to the erdep raster and generate a map for the report.<br>

Note: the differences in the erdep are subtle and the default color table will almost assuredly render<br>
the erosion deposition map in a way that little detail is revealed. You are free to<br>
experiment with the the tools in Arc in order to define classification scheme which will<br>
reveal the erosion/deposition pattern. Here's an option that should yield pretty good contrast<br>
between erosion and deposition:<br>

Open Layer Properties for the erdep layer<br>
Under the Symbology tabâ€š<br>
Select Classified from options (Unique Values, Classified, Stretched, Discrete) in the left column<br>
Set Classes to 11<br>
Choose a broad, divergent color ramp from the Color Ramp drop down field<br>
that ranges from brown grading through white to green<br>
Click on Classify<br>
Edit the eleven break values (located in column on far right in Classification dialog to:<br>
-250000.00  (data minimum)<br>
-50.00<br>
-5.00<br>
-1.00<br>
-0.10<br>
0.10<br>
1.00<br>
5.00<br>
50.00<br>
330000.00    (data maximum)<br>
Click OK<br>
Click Apply<br>

You should now see the erosion and deposition areas rendered with pretty good contrast.<br>
